//! NDim is an open-source Rust library for n-dimensional array storage, similar to NumPy in Python and ndarray in Rust. It aims to assist in scientific computation by providing efficient and flexible n-dimensional array data structures and operations. The library is designed to be performant and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for high-performance computing tasks in Rust.
//!
//! **Note:** This project is still under development, and contributions are welcome!
//!
//! ```
//! use ndim::core::NdArray;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Create an NdArray filled with a specific value
//!     let shape = [3, 2];
//!     let array = NdArray::<i32, 2>::zeros(shape);
//!
//!     // Print the array
//!     for i in 0..array.shape()[0] {
//!         for j in 0..array.shape()[1] {
//!             // access the value from memory
//!             println!("{}", array[[i, j]]);
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Features
//! + **N-Dimensional Array Storage:** Efficient storage and manipulation of n-dimensional arrays.
//! + **Generic Data Types:** Supports various numeric types, including integers and floating-point numbers.
//! + **Basic Array Operations:** Provides basic operations such as array creation, indexing, and element-wise operations.
//!
//! ## Upcoming Features
//!
//! + **Fancy printing:** Print the n-dimensional array conforming to its shape.
//! + **Axes mutation:** Change values of the n-dimensional array in an axis and much more with axes.
//! + **Mapping and other looping support:** Loop over the n-dimensional array by using (viz.) map, reduce, filter, etc. methods.
//! + **BLAS Support:** Integration with Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) for advanced linear algebra operations.
