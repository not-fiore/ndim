todo:

- [ ] create and implement the `ArrayLike` trait
- [ ] generally tidy up the public api (ie removing panics for results)
- [ ] changing `NdArray` to just `Array`? the current name seems redundant 
      with the const generic parameter

## Overview

**NDim** is an open-source Rust library for n-dimensional array storage, similar to NumPy in Python and ndarray in Rust. It aims to assist in scientific computation by providing efficient and flexible n-dimensional array data structures and operations. The library is designed to be performant and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for high-performance computing tasks in Rust.

**Note:** This project is still under development, and contributions are welcome!

## Features

- **N-Dimensional Array Storage:** Efficient storage and manipulation of n-dimensional arrays.
- **Generic Data Types:** Supports various numeric types, including integers and floating-point numbers.
- **Basic Array Operations:** Provides basic operations such as array creation, indexing, and element-wise operations.

## Upcoming Features

- **Fancy printing:** - Print the n-dimensional array conforming to its shape.
- **Axes mutation:** - Change values of the n-dimensional array in an axis and much more with axes.
- **Mapping and other looping support:** Loop over the n-dimensional array by using (viz.) map, reduce, filter, etc. methods.
- **BLAS Support:** Integration with Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) for advanced linear algebra operations.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ndim = { git = "https://github.com/noobsiecoder/ndim.git" }
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use `NDim`:

```rust
use ndim::core::NdArray;

fn main() {
    // Create an NdArray filled with a specific value
    let shape = [3, 2];
    let array = NdArray::<i32, 2>::zeros(shape);

    // Print the array
    for i in 0..array.shape()[0] {
        for j in 0..array.shape()[1] {
            println!("{}", array[[i, j]]); // access the value from memory
        }
    }
}
```
